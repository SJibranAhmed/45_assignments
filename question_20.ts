/*Question: 20 :Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of
 mountains,rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. 
Write a program that creates a list containing these items. */

//I created a list of items of rivers
let riversOfPakistan: string[] = [
  "indus",
  "jhelum",
  "ravi",
  "chenab",
  "sutleg",
];

//print the value of list
console.log(`"${riversOfPakistan.join("-")} all are rivers of Pakistan`);
